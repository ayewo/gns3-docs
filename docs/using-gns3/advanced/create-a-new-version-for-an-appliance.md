Manufacturers release new versions of their appliances every day. The GNS3 community does not always know about these new releases and updates to the appliance file, but GNS3 allows you to use an unknown version of an appliance.

:::note
This version of the appliance has not tested and might not work in GNS3 donâ€™t hesitate to share your feedback on the forum [https://gns3.com/community](https://gns3.com/community)
:::

## Create a new version from the appliances wizard

Import the ```.gns3a``` file as usual. When GNS3 list all the version at appliance import click on Create a new version.

<img alt="screenshot" src={useBaseUrl('img/using-gns3/advanced/create-a-new-version-for-an-appliance/1.jpg')} />

Give your version a name

<img alt="screenshot" src={useBaseUrl('img/using-gns3/advanced/create-a-new-version-for-an-appliance/2.jpg')} />

After that, you can import your appliance disk

<img alt="screenshot" src={useBaseUrl('img/using-gns3/advanced/create-a-new-version-for-an-appliance/3.jpg')} />

After that, it will work like any other appliance.
